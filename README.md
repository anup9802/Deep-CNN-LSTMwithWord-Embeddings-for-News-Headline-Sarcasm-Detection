# Deep-CNN-LSTMwithWord-Embeddings-for-News-Headline-Sarcasm-Detection

Sarcasm detection is one of the challenging problems in NLP. Due to complexity of the topic many architectures/methods have been investigated in past. Amongst many, the AI/ML based methods were found be providing better results. In the paper https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/deep-cnn-lstm-with-word-embeddings-for-news-headline-sarcasm-det/16742710 , the authors have presented a unique deep neural network based sarcasm detection in the news headlines, by leveraging the power of CNN and LSTM. The architecture in the paper used consists of an embedding layer, a CNN and a BiLSTM layer on word-level vector encodings on news headlines. The deep CNN-LSTM model used in the paper could achieve an accuracy of 86.16%. The authors also claimed that many models were tested and the major challenge was to achieve a model which does not overfit. 

The work in this repository is the implementation of the above paper in a different dataset. As authors claimed, the approach is highly susceptible to overfitting. The above approach resulted maximum 80.38% validation accuracy. I will be trying some other methods to increase the accuracy and will share in subsequent repo.
